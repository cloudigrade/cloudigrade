REST API Example Usage
======================

This document summarizes some examples of the cloudigrade REST API.

..
    This document can be regenerated by a developer using the following
    make target from the root directory of a sandbox environment having
    database ports forwarded locally:

    make docs-api-examples

    Please note that this is a destructive operation because building the data
    for the document requires creating, updating, and deleting many objects.

Examples here use the ``http`` command from
`httpie <https://httpie.org/>`_. If you want to follow along with these
exact commands, you may need to ``brew install httpie`` or
``pip install httpie`` first.

These examples also assume you are running cloudigrade on
``localhost:8080`` either via ``docker-compose`` or Django’s built-in
``runserver`` command and that you have correctly configured
cloudigrade’s environment with appropriate variables to allow it to talk
to the various clouds (e.g. ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``).

Authorization
-------------

The v2 API is authenticated with 3scale. In order to authenticate a `HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY` header must be included in the request.
This header must be the base64 encoded version of:


{{ v2_rh_identity | tojson(indent=4) | rst_codeblock("json") }}

.. code:: bash

    HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY={{v2_header}}

Overview
--------

The following resource paths are currently available:

-  ``/api/v2/accounts/`` returns accounts data
-  ``/api/v2/instances/`` returns instances data
-  ``/api/v2/images/`` returns images data
-  ``/api/v2/sysconfig/`` returns sysconfig data
-  ``/api/v2/concurrent/`` returns concurrency data


User Setup
------------------

When accessing any endpoint with the HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY header,
if the user found in the header does not exist, it will be created.
Users can also be created using Django Admin.


Customer Account Setup
----------------------

Create an AWS account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This request may take a few seconds because of multiple round-trip calls
to the AWS APIs for each region. The "name" attribute is required and has a
maximum supported length of 256 characters.

Request:

{{ v2_account_create.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_create | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If you attempt to create an AWS account for an ARN that is already in
the system, you should get a 400 error.

Request:

{{ v2_account_create_duplicate_arn.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_create_duplicate_arn | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Customer Account Info
---------------------

List all accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_account_list.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_list | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_account_get.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_get | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Update a specific account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can update the account object via either HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT. All
updates require you to specify the "resourcetype".

At the time of this writing, only the "name" property can be changed on the
account object.

Request:

{{ v2_account_patch.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_patch | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

Because PUT is intended to replace objects, it must include all potentially
writable fields, which includes "name" and "account_arn".

Request:

{{ v2_account_put.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_put | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

You cannot change the ARN via PUT or PATCH.

Request:

{{ v2_account_patch_arn_fail.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_patch_arn_fail | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Instance Info
-------------

List all instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_instance_list.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_list | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_instance_get.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_get | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Filtering instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may include an optional "user_id" query string argument to filter results
down to a specific user.

Request:

{{ v2_instance_filter.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_filter | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


You may also include an optional "running_since" query string argument to filter for only
instances that have been running uninterrupted since the given time.

Request:

{{ v2_instance_filter_running.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_filter_running | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Machine Images
--------------

List all images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below command will return all images that have been seen used by any instance for any account belonging to the user that makes the request.

Request:

{{ v2_list_images.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_images | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

When authenticating as a superuser, this will return all images used by instances in all accounts.

A superuser can also filter the images down to a those used by instances for accounts belonging to a specific user by using the optional
``user_id`` query string argument.

Request:

{{ v2_list_images_filter.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_images_filter | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_get_image.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_get_image | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Reinspect a specific image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cloudigrade/account/v2/serializers.py
Restart image inspection to deal with failed inspections or repeat inspection for the sake of testing.

Note that this command is only accessible by superusers.

Request:

{{ v2_reinspect_image.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_reinspect_image | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Report Commands
---------------

These APIs may be used to generate calculated and aggregated report data.

Daily Max Concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concurrency API returns a paginated list of days, and each day includes the
maximum concurrent number of instances, number of vCPUs, and amount of memory
in GBs seen concurrently in use during that day.

Optional ``start_date`` is an ISO-8601 date that is the inclusive start of the
reporting period. If not defined, default is "today".

Optional ``end_date`` is an ISO-8601 date that is the exclusive end of the
reporting period. If not defined, default is "tomorrow".

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If your requested ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` values would result in
future dates beyond "today", those future dates will not be included. Daily
max concurrency results will end "today" at the latest. In the following
example, the request is for dates "tomorrow" through "one week from today".

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_future.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_future | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

Miscellaneous Commands
----------------------

Retrieve current publicly-viewable system configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sysconfig endpoint includes the AWS cloud account id used by the application, AWS policies used for acting on behalf of customers, and the currently deployed backend version.

Request:

{{ v2_get_sysconfig.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_get_sysconfig | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}
