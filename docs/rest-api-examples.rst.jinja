REST API Example Usage
======================

This document summarizes some examples of the cloudigrade REST API.

..
    This document can be regenerated by a developer using the following
    make target from the root directory of a sandbox environment having
    database ports forwarded locally:

    make docs-api-examples

Examples here use the ``http`` command from
`httpie <https://httpie.org/>`_. If you want to follow along with these
exact commands, you may need to ``brew install httpie`` or
``pip install httpie`` first.

These examples also assume you are running cloudigrade on
``localhost:8080`` and that you have correctly configured
cloudigrade’s environment with appropriate variables to allow it to talk
to the various clouds (e.g. ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``).

Authorization
-------------

The v2 API is authenticated with a custom HTTP header. In order to authenticate,
a `HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY` header must be included in the request.
This header must be the base64 encoded version of:


{{ v2_rh_identity | tojson(indent=4) | rst_codeblock("json") }}

.. code:: bash

    HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY={{v2_header}}

Overview
--------

The following resource paths are currently available:

-  ``/api/v2/accounts/`` returns accounts data
-  ``/api/v2/instances/`` returns instances data
-  ``/api/v2/images/`` returns images data
-  ``/api/v2/sysconfig/`` returns sysconfig data
-  ``/api/v2/concurrent/`` returns concurrency data


User Setup
------------------

When accessing any endpoint with the HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY header,
if the user found in the header does not exist, it will not be created.


Customer Account Info
---------------------

List all accounts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_account_list.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_list | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_account_get.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_account_get | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_instance_list.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_list | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_instance_get.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_get | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Filtering instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may also include an optional "running_since" query string argument to filter for only
instances that have been running uninterrupted since the given time.

Request:

{{ v2_instance_filter_running.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_instance_filter_running | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Machine Images
--------------

List all images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below command will return all images that have been seen used by any instance for any account belonging to the user that makes the request.

Request:

{{ v2_list_images.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_images | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Retrieve a specific image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Request:

{{ v2_get_image.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_get_image | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Report Commands
---------------

These APIs may be used to generate calculated and aggregated report data.

Daily Max Concurrency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The concurrency API returns a paginated list of days, and each day includes the
maximum concurrent number of instances, grouped by various combinations of role,
sla, and architecture seen concurrently in use during that day.

Optional ``start_date`` is an ISO-8601 date that is the inclusive start of the
reporting period. If not defined, default is "yesterday".

Optional ``end_date`` is an ISO-8601 date that is the exclusive end of the
reporting period. If not defined, default is "today".

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If your requested ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` values would result in some
dates that not completed their calculations, the server will return ``425 Too Early``.

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_too_early.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_too_early | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If your requested ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` values would result in some
future dates beyond "yesterday", the API will return a 400 with the relevant errors.
Daily max concurrency results will end "yesterday" at the latest.

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_partial_future.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_partial_future | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If your requested ``start_date`` and ``end_date`` values would result in exclusively
future dates beyond "yesterday", the API will also return a 400 with the relevant errors.
 In the following example, the request is for dates "tomorrow" through "one week from today".

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_all_future.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_all_future | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

If your requested ``end_date`` value is not greater then that of the user
``date_joined``, the api will return a 400 with the relevant error.

Request:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_past_end_date.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_list_concurrent_past_end_date | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}

Miscellaneous Commands
----------------------

Retrieve current publicly-viewable system configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The sysconfig endpoint includes the AWS cloud account id used by the application, AWS policies used for acting on behalf of customers, and the currently deployed backend version.

Request:

{{ v2_get_sysconfig.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

Response:

{{ v2_get_sysconfig | stringify_http_response | rst_codeblock }}


Internal APIs
-------------

The following APIs are only available internally and are not fully supported.
Caveat emptor. Hic sunt dracones.


Create an AWS account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This request may take a few seconds because of multiple round-trip calls
to the AWS APIs for each region. The "name" attribute is required and has a
maximum supported length of 256 characters. The "platform_authentication_id",
"platform_application_id", "platform_endpoint_id", and "platform_source_id"
attributes are all required and should be integers.

Request:

{{ internal_account_create_aws.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}

If you attempt to create an AWS account for an ARN that is already in
the system, you should get a 400 error.

Request:

{{ internal_account_create_aws_duplicate_arn.wsgi_request | httpied_command(version=2) | rst_codeblock("bash") }}
