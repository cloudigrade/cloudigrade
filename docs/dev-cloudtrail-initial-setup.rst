***********************************

S3 setup
========
#. log in to the AWS web console for the account running the ECS houndigrade cluster
#. go to the s3 (Simple Storage Service) page
#. click "Create bucket"
#. enter a name for your bucket matching the following format "`AWS_NAME_PREFIX`cloudigrade-s3" the `AWS_NAME_PREFIX` already has a "-" at the end so for example if my `AWS_NAME_PREFIX` is "aaiken-" then I would name my s3 bucket "aaiken-cloudigrade-s3"
#. select a region (us-east-1) and click "Next"
#. the default properties and permissions are OK, click "Next" until you reach the "Review" step
#. click "Create bucket"
#. once you have created your bucket, select it by clicking on the block (not directly on the bucket name) to bring up a side bar
#. at the top of the bar select the option "Copy Bucket ARN"
#. save your bucket ARN as you will need it for later in the setup

SQS setup
=========
#. navigate to the SQS (Simple Queue Service) page
#. click "Create New Queue"
#. give the queue a reasonably unique name ("yourname-cloudigrade-sqs")
#. select Standard Queue and click "Quick-Create Queue"
#. select your queue and navigate to the "Details" tab
#. copy your queue ARN and save it for use later in the setup
#. with your queue still selected, click on the "Permissions" tab
#. click "Edit Policy Document (Advanced)"
#. replace the contents of the text editor with the following:

   .. code-block:: json

       {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Id": "CHANGE_TO_UNIQUE_ID",
          "Statement": [
            {
