        Test calling initial_aws_describe_instances twice with no data changes.

        This test asserts appropriate behavior if we call account.enable after
        performing the initial AWS account describe once but without generating any new
        activity after the initial describe. This is likely to happen for AWS accounts
        with any long-running instances that have not changed state since the last time
        account.enable was called. Since our account availability checks routinely call
        account.enable to verify permissions, we need to test handling this use case.

        Why is this a concern? We used to naively *always* insert a new InstanceEvent
        for a running instance seen within initial_aws_describe_instances. That's not a
        problem in isolation; the new event would result in the runs being recreated and
        concurrent usage being recalculated. However, this becomes a problem if the
        instance's run spans many days (meaning many more recalculations) or if the
        account.enable function (which also calls initial_aws_describe_instances) is
        being called frequently, which may be the case since we cannot control when
        external callers hit an account's availability_check endpoint.

        A resolution to this concern is to perform an existence check before allowing
        initial_aws_describe_instances to insert a new InstanceEvent. If the most recent
        event is power_on, then we don't need to store another power_on, and we don't
        need to rebuild the run and recalculate concurrent usages. The updated expected
        behavior of calling account.enable shortly after initial_aws_describe_instances
        is that no new InstantEvent objects will be created by account.enable if a
        running described instance's most recent event is power_on.
