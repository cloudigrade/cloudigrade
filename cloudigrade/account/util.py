    Create AwsInstance and AwsInstanceEvent the first time we see an instance.

    This function is a convenience helper for recording the first time we
    discover a running instance wherein we assume that "now" is the earliest
    known time that the instance was running.

    Args:
        account (AwsAccount): The account that owns the instance that spawned
            the data for these InstanceEvents.
        instances_data (dict): Dict whose keys are AWS region IDs and values
            are each a list of dictionaries that represent an instance

    Returns:
        dict: Similar to the incoming instances_data dict, the returned dict
        has keys that are AWS region IDs and values that are each a list of the
        created InstanceEvent objects.
