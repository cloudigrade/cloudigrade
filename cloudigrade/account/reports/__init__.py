    Group the events by multiple dimensions in nested dicts.

    At the outer later, the keys are "product type" strings. These are a
    combination of (virtual) hardware definition and found software product
    that ultimately each needs to be reported with a sum total of running time.
    At the next layer, the keys are the instance IDs. Finally, each of those
    instance ID keys points to a list of InstanceEvents that belong to it.

    This "double nesting" of product+instance is necessary because instance IDs
    alone would not be sufficient for grouping because some cloud providers
    allow resizing of an existing instance without changing/replacing its ID.

    For example, a returned structure might look like:

        {
            'aws-t2.micro-rhel7': {
                'i-05f78714782d7979b': [
