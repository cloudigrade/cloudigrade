What is cloudigrade?
====================

**cloudigrade** is an open-source suite of tools for tracking RHEL use in public cloud platforms. **cloudigrade** actively checks a user's account in a particular cloud for running instances, tracks when instances are powered on, determines if RHEL is installed on them, and provides the ability to generate reports to see how many cloud compute resources have been used in a given time period.


What are "Doppler" and "Cloud Meter"?
-------------------------------------

Doppler was an early code name for **cloudigrade**. Cloud Meter is a product-ized Red Hat name for its running **cloudigrade** service. ``cloudigrade == Doppler == Cloud Meter`` for all intents and purposes. ðŸ˜‰


Running cloudigrade
===================

Developer Environment
---------------------

Because **cloudigrade** is actually a suite of interacting services, setting up a development environment may require installing some or all of the following dependencies:

-  Python 3.8
-  `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_
-  `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/>`_
-  `Docker Desktop <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_
-  `gettext <https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>`_
-  `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>`_
-  `AWS Command Line Interface <https://aws.amazon.com/cli/>`_
-  `Azure Command-Line Interface <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/>`_


macOS dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following commands should install everything you need:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew update
    brew install python@3.8 gettext awscli azure-cli postgresql openssl curl librdkafka tox poetry


Linux dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend developing on the latest version of Fedora. Follow the following commands to install the dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo dnf install awscli gettext postgresql-devel librdkafka-devel -y


Python 3.8.x
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This step is optional, but we recommend you install a local Python version via `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation>`_ instead of using the brew or dnf version. This will ensure you keep a *specific* stable version when you are working on **cloudigrade**. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    pyenv install 3.8.7
    pyenv local


Virtual Environment (via Poetry)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All Python developers should use a virtual environments to isolate their package dependencies. **cloudigrade** developers use `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_ and maintain its ``pyproject.toml`` and ``poetry.lock`` files with appropriate up-to-date requirements.

Once you have poetry installed, use it to install our Python package requirements:

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry env remove
    poetry install

If you plan to run **cloudigrade** or Celery locally on macOS, the required ``pycurl`` package may fail to install or may install improperly despite ``poetry install`` appearing to complete successfully. You should verify that ``pycurl`` is installed correctly by simply importing it in a Python shell like this:

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry run python -c 'import pycurl'

If you see no output, everything is okay! Otherwise (e.g. "libcurl link-time ssl backend (openssl) is different from compile-time ssl backend (none/other)"), it may not have installed correctly. Try the following commands (macOS users only) to force reinstalling with the openssl backend:

.. code-block:: sh

    brew update
    brew install openssl curl-openssl
    brew doctor  # ...and resolve any known problems.

    poetry run pip uninstall pycurl -y

    BREW_PATH=$(brew --prefix)
    export LDFLAGS="-L${BREW_PATH}/opt/curl/lib -L${BREW_PATH}/opt/openssl/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I${BREW_PATH}/opt/curl/include -I${BREW_PATH}/opt/openssl/include"
    export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY="openssl"

    poetry install
    poetry run python -c 'import pycurl'

If this resolves the import error, you may also need to export all of those variables any time you have `tox` recreate its own virtual environments.

If using a system that has dnf, try the following commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry run pip uninstall pycurl -y
    sudo dnf install openssl libcurl-devel
    export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl
    poetry install

Try the aforementioned import commands again, and all should be good. If not, kindly reach out to another **cloudigrade** developer to seek assistance!

After finishing the installation of dependencies, you can instantiate a shell uses the virtual environment by running ``poetry shell``.


macOS Big Sur Troubleshooting
*****************************

If you're working with macOS Big Sur you may run into issues around the system version number, in which case set ``SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1`` which will make macOS report back ``10.16`` instead of ``11.X``. For example,

.. code-block:: sh

    SYSTEM_VERSION_COMPAT=1 poetry install

You'll likely also run into more issues with installing pycurl. Follow the following steps to get back on track.

.. code-block:: sh

    poetry shell
    pip uninstall pycurl -y
    export LDFLAGS="-L${BREW_PATH}/opt/curl/lib"
    export CPPFLAGS="-I${BREW_PATH}/opt/curl/include"
    pip install --no-cache-dir --compile --ignore-installed --install-option="--with-openssl" --install-option="--openssl-dir=/usr/local/opt/openssl@1.1" pycurl


Configure AWS account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't already, create an `Amazon Web Services <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_ account for **cloudigrade** to use for its AWS API calls. You will need the AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, and region name where the account operates.

Use the AWS CLI to save that configuration to your local system:

.. code-block:: bash

    aws configure

You can verify that settings were stored correctly by checking the files it created in your ``~/.aws/`` directory.

**cloudigrade** requires several environment variables to talk with AWS. Ensure you have *at least* the following variables set in your local environment *before* you start running **cloudigrade**. Even if you don't intend to work with AWS at first, these must not be empty or else app startup will fail.

-  ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``
-  ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``

Many other optional AWS-specific variables are read at startup that may be useful for configuring your local environment and distinguishing yours from other developers. Here is a short list of *some* environment variables you probably want to set. See ``config/settings/*.py`` for more.

-  ``AWS_DEFAULT_REGION``: default AWS region
-  ``AWS_SQS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``: AWS Access Key ID for SQS
-  ``AWS_SQS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``: AWS Secret Access Key for SQS
-  ``AWS_SQS_REGION``: default region for SQS
-  ``AWS_NAME_PREFIX``: prefix for various AWS objects (S3 buckets, SQS queues); best practice is to set this to your name like ``${USER}-``
-  ``AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME``: name of S3 bucket that receives CloudTrail logs
-  ``AWS_CLOUDTRAIL_EVENT_URL``: URL of SQS queue that receives S3 notifications
-  ``HOUNDIGRADE_ECS_CLUSTER_NAME``: name of ECS cluster for houndigrade
-  ``HOUNDIGRADE_AWS_AUTOSCALING_GROUP_NAME``: name of EC2 AutoScaling group for ECS
-  ``HOUNDIGRADE_AWS_AVAILABILITY_ZONE``: availability zone for ECS EC2 instances


Specify Django settings module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For convenience, you may want to set the following environment variable:

.. code-block:: sh

    DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=config.settings.local

If you do not set that variable, you may need to include the ``--settings=config.settings.local`` argument with any Django admin or management commands you run.


Configure AWS Policy for Capturing ECS Logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For ECS to be able to write logs to CloudWatch, we'll need to create and assign it the ecs role.

First we'll create the policy.

- Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
- In the navigation pane, choose Policies.
- Choose Create policy, JSON.
- Enter the following policy:
.. code-block:: json

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "CloudigradePolicy",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ec2:DescribeImages",
                    "ec2:DescribeInstances",
                    "ec2:ModifySnapshotAttribute",
                    "ec2:DescribeSnapshotAttribute",
                    "ec2:DescribeSnapshots",
                    "ec2:CopyImage",
                    "ec2:CreateTags",
                    "ec2:DescribeRegions",
                    "cloudtrail:CreateTrail",
                    "cloudtrail:UpdateTrail",
                    "cloudtrail:PutEventSelectors",
                    "cloudtrail:DescribeTrails",
                    "cloudtrail:StartLogging",
                    "cloudtrail:StopLogging",
                ],
                "Resource": "*",
            }
        ],
    }

- Choose Review policy.
- On the Review policy page, enter ECS-CloudWatchLogs for the Name and choose Create policy.

Next, we will attach the policy.

- Open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/.
- In the navigation pane, choose Roles.
- Choose ecsInstanceRole.
- Choose Permissions, Attach policy.
- To narrow the available policies to attach, for Filter, type ECS-CloudWatchLogs.
- Check the box to the left of the ECS-CloudWatchLogs policy and choose Attach policy.

You'll be able to view CloudWatch Logs `here <https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logs:>`_, there will be a log group created for your ecs cluster.


Common commands
===============

Testing
-------

To run all local tests as well as our code-quality checking commands:

.. code-block:: sh

    tox

If ``tox`` cannot create its environment due to errors installing pycurl, try setting these environment variables first:

.. code-block:: sh

    export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib
    export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include
    export PYCURL_SSL_LIBRARY=openssl

If you wish to run *only* the tests:

.. code-block:: sh

    make unittest

If you wish to run a higher-level suite of integration tests, see `integrade <https://github.com/cloudigrade/integrade>`_.

Updating API Example Docs
-------------------------

You may run the following Make target to generate the API examples documentation:

.. code-block:: sh

    make docs-api-examples

This will create many use-case-specific records in the database, simulate API calls through cloudigrade, and generate an updated document with the API calls. You should review any changes made by this command before adding and committing them to source control.

Generate a Spec File
--------------------

Generation of the spec file is handled by the same mechanism that serves our spec file via api, to ensure that they are the same. If you've recently made changes to the api and need to update the spec file, run the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    make spec

Otherwise, if you'd simply like to verify that the spec is current, you can run the following:

.. code-block:: sh

    make spec-test


Authentication
==============

Custom HTTP header authentication is used to authenticate users.
For a local deployment, this means including a ``HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY``
header in all requests.

API access is restricted to authenticated users.

For more information about this header see `examples. <./docs/rest-api-example.rst#Authorization>`_


When accessing any endpoint with the ``HTTP_X_RH_IDENTITY`` header,
if the user found in the header does not exist, it will be created.
It is also possible to programmatically create users on the command line,
for instance for testing. To create a user this way, use:

.. code-block:: sh

    make user


Message Broker
==============

Amazon SQS is used to broker messages between **cloudigrade**, Celery workers, and houndigrade.


Kafka Listener
==============

``listen_to_sources`` is a special Django management command whose purpose is to listen to the Red Hat Insights platform Kafka instance. Currently we only listen to a topic from the `Sources API <https://github.com/RedHatInsights/sources-api>`_ to inform us of when new source authentication objects are created so we can proceed to add them to **cloudigrade**.

Several environment variables may override defaults from ``config.settings`` to configure this command:

- ``LISTENER_TOPIC`` - The topic to listen to
- ``LISTENER_GROUP_ID`` - The listener group
- ``LISTENER_SERVER`` - Kafka server
- ``LISTENER_PORT`` -  Kafka server port
- ``LISTENER_AUTO_COMMIT`` - Whether the messages being received should be marked as so
- ``LISTENER_TIMEOUT`` - Timeout of the listener
- ``LISTENER_PID_PATH`` - The path of the pid file
- ``SOURCES_ENABLE_DATA_MANAGEMENT_FROM_KAFKA`` - bool to feature-flag creation and deletion of users and cloud accounts driven by Kafka messages. When disabled, cloudigrade will only log a message when it reads from the Kafka topic.

The listener will be automatically deployed to all OSD environments, including review. If you'd like to run it locally you don't need to do anything special, simply be in your virtual environment, set your environment variables, and call ``python cloudigrade/manage.py listen_to_sources``.
